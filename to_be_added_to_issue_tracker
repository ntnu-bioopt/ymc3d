#1: Licensing issues
YMC3D uses a GPL-licensed RNG component from GPU-MCML. I'd rather this project to be fully licensed under a permissive license. A clean-room implementation of the same RNG algorithm is needed. 

#2: File format
YMC3D currently uses a binary file format for both input and output. This is not optimal, and should be exchanged for a plaintext ASCII format. 

#3. Definitions.txt
YMC3D currently has e.g. number of photons and boundary conditions and other properties hard coded. It would be better to have this as a part of a parameter file to be input on the command line. See also issue #4. 

#4. Hard coding
Boundary conditions, whether absorption properties should be saved, are currently hard coded into the device functions. It would be better if the function prototypes took this in as a function argument. 

#5. Working MATLAB geometry/tissue generation examples
The provided examples serve as a rough outline of how the tissue and geometry can be generated and are not working examples. 
This was mainly for avoiding the need to include too many files containing absorption properties. I'd rather make 
more coherent, runnable examples after defining a coherent library for organizing and obtaining tissue properties across both MATLAB and C (so that e.g. gpu-dm don't have to use this incoherent absorption_props.cpp interface, which is a strange way to do it).
